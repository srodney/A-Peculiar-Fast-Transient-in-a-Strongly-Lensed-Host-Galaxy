Two unusual transient events were observed by the Hubble Space
Telescope in 2014, appearing in a galaxy at z=1.0054$\pm$0.0002 that
is gravitationally lensed by the galaxy cluster \macs0416. These
transients---collectively nicknamed ``Spock''--- were faster and
fainter than any supernova, but significantly more luminous than a
classical nova: they reached peak luminosities of $\sim10^{41}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ in $\lesssim$5 rest-frame days, then faded below
detectability in roughly the same timespan. Lens models of the foreground
cluster suggest that it is entirely plausible that the two events are
{\it spatially} coincident at the source plane, but very unlikely that
they were also {\it temporally} coincident.  We find that {\it Spock} can
plausibly be classified as a recurrent nova, a luminous blue variable,
or a stellar caustic crossing event---but all three explanations
require either an extreme astrophysical source or highly unusual
gravitational lensing.
