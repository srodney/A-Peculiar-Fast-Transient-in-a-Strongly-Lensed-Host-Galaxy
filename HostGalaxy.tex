\subsection{Host Galaxy}\label{sec:HostGalaxy}

To examine whether the two transients originated from the same
physical location in the source plane, we looked for differences in
the properties of the \spock host galaxy at the location of each
event.  We first used the technique of ``pixel-by-pixel'' SED fitting
as described in \citet{Hemmati:2014} to determine rest-frame colors
and stellar properties in a single resolution element of the \HST
imaging data.  For this purpose we used the deepest possible stacks of
\HST images, comprising all available data except those images where
the transient events were present.  The resulting maps of stellar
population properties are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:HostProperties}.
Table~\ref{tab:HostProperties} reports measurements of the three
derived stellar population properties (color, mass, age) from host
images 11.1, 11.2 and 11.3.  In 11.1 and 11.2 these measurements were
extracted from the central pixel at the location of each of the two
\spock events.  The lensing magnification here ranges from
$\mu=10$ to 100 (see Section~\ref{sec:LensingModels}), corresponding
to a size on the source plane between 6 and 600 pc$^2$.  For host
image 11.3 we report the stellar population properties derived from
the pixel at the center of the galaxy, because the lens models do not
have sufficient precision to map the \spock locations to specific
positions in image 11.3.  With a magnification of $\sim$3 to 5, this
extraction region covers roughly 2000 to 6000 pc$^2$.

The reported uncertainties for these derived stellar properties in
Table~\ref{tab:HostProperties} reflect only the measurement errors
from the SED fitting, and do not attempt to quantify potential
systematic biases.  Such biases could arise, for example, from color
differences in the background light, which is dominated by the cluster
galaxies and varies significantly across the \MACS0416 field.  Such a
bias might shift the absolute values of the parameter scales for any
given host image (e.g., making the galaxy as a whole appear bluer,
more massive and younger). However, the gradients across any single
host image are unlikely to be driven primarily by such systematics.

Figure~\ref{fig:HostProperties} and Table~\ref{tab:HostProperties}
show that the measured values of the color, stellar mass, and age at
the two \spock locations are mutually consistent. Thus, it is
plausible to assume that the two positions map back to the same
physical location at the source plane.  Comparing those two locations
to the center of the galaxy as defined in image 11.3, we see only a
mild tension in the rest-frame U-V color. This comparison therefore
cannot quantitatively rule out the possibility that the two transient
events are located at the center of the galaxy. However, the maps
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:HostProperties} do show a gradient in both
U-V color and stellar age. For both images 11.1 and 11.2 the bluest
and youngest stars (U-V$\sim$0.3, $\tau\sim$280 Myr) are localized in
knots near the extreme ends of each image, well separated from either
of the \spock transient events.  In the less distorted host image 11.3
the bluer and younger stars are concentrated near the center. Taken
together, these color and age gradients suggest that the two
transients are not coincident with the center of their host galaxy.

In addition to the \HST imaging data, we also have spatially resolved
spectroscopy from the MUSE integral field data. The only significant
spectral line feature for the \spock host is the \forbidden{O}{ii}
($\lambda\lambda$ 3727, 3729) doublet, observed at 7474 and 7478
\AA. Figure~\ref{fig:MUSEOIISequence} shows the observed
\forbidden{O}{ii} lines at 10 positions along the length of the arc,
which comprises images 11.1 and 11.2. Each extraction has been
normalized to show a peak line flux at unity, so that the line
profiles and the doublet line ratios may be more easily compared.  At
each position the lines were extracted using apertures with a radius
of 0\farcs6, so adjacent extractions are not independent, although the
two extractions centered on the \spockone and -SE positions have no
overlap.

From each extracted 1-D spectrum the integrated line flux, observed
wavelength of line center ($\lambda_{\rm center}$), and full width at
half maximum (FWHM) were found by fitting a Gaussian profile to each
component of the doublet.  Properties derived from these line fits are
reported in Table~\ref{tab:MuseLineFits}. The \forbidden{O}{ii} lines
do not exhibit any discernible gradient across the host galaxy images
in terms of the wavelength of line centers, full width at half
maximum, or the intensity ratio of the two components of the doublet.
Thus, the \forbidden{O}{ii} measurements from MUSE cannot be used to
distinguish either \spock location from the other, or to definitively
answer whether either position is coincident with the center of the
host galaxy.  We conclude that it is plausible but not certain that
the two \spock events arose from the same physical location in the
host galaxy.
