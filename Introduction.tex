\TODO{discuss the HFF survey, the FrontierSN program, and the value of discovering strongly lensed transient events.}


In Sections 2-5 we develop three key observables for the \spock
events: (1) they are both more luminous than a classical nova, but
less luminous than a SN, reaching a peak luminosity of roughly
$10^{41}$ erg s$^{−1}$ ($M_V=−14$); (2) both transients exhibited fast
light curves, with rise and decline timescales of $\sim2--5$ days in
the rest frame; (3) it is likely that both events arose from the same
physical location but were not coincident in time---they were probably
separated by 3-5 months in the rest frame.
