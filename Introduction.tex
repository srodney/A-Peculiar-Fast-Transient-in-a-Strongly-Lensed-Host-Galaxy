\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}

The Spock transient events---separately designated \spockone and
\spocktwo---appeared in Hubble Space Telescope (\HST) imaging collected
in January and August of 2014, respectively (Figure
\ref{fig:SpockDetectionImages}).  These images were centered on the galaxy
cluster \MACS0416\ (hereafter, MACS0416) and were collected as part of
the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) survey (HST-PID:13496, PI:Lotz), a
multi-cycle program for deep imaging of 6 massive galaxy clusters and
associated ``blank sky'' fields observed in parallel.

Combining the \HST imaging and lens models of the MACS0416 gravitational
lens leads to three key observables for the \spock events: (1) they are
both more luminous than a classical nova, but less luminous than
almost all supernovae (SNe), reaching a peak luminosity of roughly
$10^{41}$ erg s$^{−1}$ ($M_V=−14$); (2) both transients exhibited fast
light curves, with rise and decline timescales of $\sim2--5$ days in
the rest frame; and (3) it is likely that both events arose from the
same physical location but were not coincident in time---they were
probably separated by 3-5 months in the rest frame. These peculiar
transients thus present an intriguing puzzle: they are broadly
consistent with the expected behavior of stellar explosions (they each
exhibit a single isolated rise and decline in brightness), but they
can not be trivially classified into any of the common categories of
explosive or eruptive astrophysical transients.  

% Until recently, most surveys searching for extragalactic optical
% transients have been optimized for the discovery of SNe, and
% particularly for Type Ia SNe, because of their value as cosmological
% probes \citep[e.g.,][and references therein]{Weinberg:2013}.  These
% surveys have favored a cadence of several days between return visits,
% with relatively short exposures to maximize the area of sky covered
% while remaining sensitive to their primary targets---relatively bright
% Type Ia SNe.  Although recent surveys are beginning to discover more
% and more categories of rapidly changing optical transients
% \citep[e.g.][]{Kasliwal:2011,Drout:2014} most programs remain largely
% insensitive to transients with peak brightness and timescales
% comparable to the \spock events \citep{Berger:2013}.  Future
% wide-field observatories such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
% \citep[LSST,][]{Tyson:2002} will be much more efficient at discovering
% such transients, and can be expected to reveal many new categories of
% astrophysical transients.   

The HFF survey was not designed with discovery of peculiar
extragalactic transients as a core objective, but it has
unintentionally opened an unusual window of discovery for such events.
Very faint sources at relatively high redshift in these fields are
made detectable by the substantial gravitational lensing magnification
of the foreground galaxy clusters.  Very rapidly evolving sources are
also more likely to be found, due to the necessity of a rapid cadence
for repeat imaging in the HFF program.  These unusual characteristics
for an \HST survey contributed to the early detection and
characterization of SN Refsdal, the first SN that is strongly lensed
into multiple resolved images \citep{Kelly:2015a}.  The HFF imaging
program has also enabled a precise measurement of the lensing
magnification for SN Tomas, a high-redshift Type Ia SN
\citep{Rodney:2015a}.   Both of those SNe constitute fairly common
astrophysical phenomena, and the possibility of discovering such
transients was anticipated at the start of the HFF program.  \spock,
however, appears to be {\it sui generis}.  No single astrophysical
model is clearly sufficient to explain all of the available
observational data, and the best available models require either an
extreme stellar source or a very unusual gravitational lensing
configuration.
