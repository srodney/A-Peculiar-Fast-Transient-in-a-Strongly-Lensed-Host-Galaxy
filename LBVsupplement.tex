\subsection{LBV Light-Curve Comparison.}
\label{sec:LBVlightcurves}

Supplementary Figure~\ref{fig:LBVLightCurveComparison} presents a direct
comparison of the observed \spock light curves against the light
curves of the two LBVs that have well-studied rapid eruptions: SN
2009ip and NGC3432-LBV1. The brief outbursts of these LBVs have been
less finely sampled than the two \spock events, but the available data
show a wide variety of rise and decline times, even for a single
object over a relatively narrow time window of a few months.
