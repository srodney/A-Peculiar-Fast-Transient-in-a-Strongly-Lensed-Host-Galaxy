\section{Observations}\label{sec:Observations}

The transient \spock\ was discovered in HST imaging collected as part
of the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) survey (HST-PID:13496, PI:Lotz), a
multi-cycle program observing 6 massive galaxy clusters and associated
``blank sky'' parallel fields.  Several HST observing programs have
provided additional observations supplementing the core HFF program.
One of these is the FrontierSN program (HST-PID:13386, PI:Rodney),
which aims to identify and study explosive transients found in the HFF
and related programs.  The FrontierSN team discovered \spock\ in two
separate HFF observing campaigns on the galaxy cluster
\MACS0416\ (hereafter, MACS0416).  The first was an imaging campaign
in January, 2014 during which the MACS0416 cluster field was observed
in optical bands using the Advanced Camera for Surveys Wide Field
Camera (ACS-WFC).  The second concluded in August, 2014, and imaged
the cluster with the infrared detector of HST's Wide Field Camera 3
(WFC3-IR).

To discover transient sources, the FrontierSN team processes each new
epoch of HST data through a difference imaging
pipeline\footnote{\url{https://github.com/srodney/sndrizpipe}}, using
archival HST images to provide reference images (templates) which are
subtracted from the astrometrically registered HFF images. In the case
of MACS0416, the templates were constructed from images collected as
part of the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH,
HST-PID:12459, PI:Postman). The resulting difference images are
visually inspected for new point sources, and any new transients of
interest (primarily supernovae, SNe) are followed up with additional
HST imaging or ground-based spectroscopic observations as needed.  For
a more complete description of the operations of the FrontierSN
program, see \citet{Rodney:2015a}.

The follow-up observations for \spock\ included HST observations in
infrared and optical bands using the WFC3-IR and ACS-WFC detectors,
respectively, as well as spectroscopy of the \spock\ host galaxy using
the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and the Visible Multi-object
Spectrograph \citep[VIMOS][]{LeFevre:2003}, and also using the
X-shooter cross-dispersed echelle spectrograph
\citep{Vernet:2011}.  The X-shooter observations
(Program 093.A-0667(A), PI: J. Hjorth) were taken on October 19th,
21st and 23rd (2014) with the slit centered on the position of \spock2.  
The total integration time was 4.0 hours for the NIR arm of X-shooter, 
3.6 hours for the VIS arm, and 3.9 hours for the UVB arm.
The spectrum did not provide any
detection of the transient source itself (as we will see below, it had
already faded back to its quiescent state by that time).  However, it
did provide an unambiguous redshift for the host galaxy of
$z=1.0054\pm0.0002$ from \Ha\ and the \ionline{O}{[ii]} doublet in 
data from the NIR and VIS arms, respectively.  These line
identifications are consistent with two measures of the photometric
redshift of the host: $z=1.00+-0.02$ from the BPZ algorithm
\citep{Benitez:2000}, and $z=0.92\pm0.05$, derived using the EAZY
program \citep{Brammer:2008}.

The VIMOS observations were collected as part of the CLASH-VLT large program (Program 186.A-0.798; P.I.: P. Rosati; \citealt{Rosati:2014}), which collected $\sim$4000 reliable redshifts over 600 arcmin$^2$ in the \macs0416 field \citep{Grillo:2015a,Balestra:2015}.  These massively multi-object observations could potentially have provided confirmation of the redshift of the \spock host galaxy with separate spectral line identifications in each of the three host galaxy images.  On the \macs0416 field this program collected 1 hr of useful exposure time in good seeing conditions with the Low Resolution Blue grism.  Unfortunately, the wavelength range of this grism (3600-6700 \aa) does not include any strong emission lines for a source at z=1.0054, and the signal-to-noise (S/N) was not sufficient to provide any clear line identifications for the three images of the \spock host galaxy. 

A final potential source for redshift information relevant to \spock is the Grism Lens Amplified Survey from Space \citep[GLASS; PID: HST-GO-13459; PI:T. Treu][]{Schmidt:2014,Treu:2015a}. The GLASS program collected slitless spectroscopy on the \macs0416 field using the WFC3-IR G102 and G141 grisms on \HST.  As with the VLT VIMOS data, the three sources identified as images of the \spock host galaxy are too faint in the GLASS data to provide any useful line identifications.  There are also no other sources in the GLASS redshift catalog\footnote{\url{http://glass.astro.ucla.edu/}} that have a spectroscopic redshift consistent with z=1.0054.   


Table \TODO{(add a table with photometry)} %~\ref{tab:Photometry}
and Figure~\ref{fig:LightCurves} present 
photometry of the \spock\ events
from all available HST observations. The flux was measured on
difference images, first using aperture photometry with a 0\farcs3
radius, and also by fitting with an empirical point spread function
(PSF).  The PSF model was defined using HST observations of the G2V
standard star P330E, observed in a separate calibration program.  A
separate PSF model was defined for each filter, but owing to the
long-term stability of the HST PSF we used the same model in all
epochs.  All of the aperture and PSF fitting photometry was carried
out using the {\tt PythonPhot} software package \citep{Jones:2015}.
