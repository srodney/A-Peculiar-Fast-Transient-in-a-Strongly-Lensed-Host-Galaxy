\subsection{X-ray Non-detections}\label{sec:Xray}

The \MACS0416 field was observed by the SWIFT X-Ray Telescope (XRT) and
UltraViolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) in April 2013.  No source was
detected near the locations of the \spock events (N. Gehrels, private
communication).  The field was also observed by the Chandra X-ray
space telescope with the ACIS-I instrument for three separate
programs.  On June 7, 2009 it was observed for GO program 10800770
(PI: H.\,Ebeling).  It was revisited for GTO program 15800052 (PI:
S.\,Murray) on November 20, 2013 and for GO program 15800858 (PI: C.\,
Jones) on June 9, August 31, November 26, and December 17, 2014. These
Chandra images show no evidence for an x-ray emitting point source
near the \spock locations on those dates (S. Murray, private
communication).
