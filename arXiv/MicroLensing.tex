\subsection{Intracluster Light.}\label{sec:ICL}

To estimate the mass of intracluster stars along the line of sight to
the \spock events, we follow the procedure of \citeref{Kelly:2017} and
Morishita et al. (in prep).  This entails fitting and removing the
surface brightness of individual galaxies in the field, then fitting a
smooth profile to the residual surface brightness of intracluster
light (ICL).  The surface brightness is then converted to a projected
stellar mass surface density by assuming a
Chabrier\cite{Chabrier:2003} initial mass function and an
exponentially declining star formation history.  This procedure leads
to an estimate for the intracluster stellar mass of $\log
(\Sigma_{\star} / (\Msun\,{\rm kpc}^{-2})) = 6.9\pm0.4$.  This is
very similar to the value of $6.8^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ inferred for the
probable caustic crossing star M1149 LS1\cite{Kelly:2017}.
