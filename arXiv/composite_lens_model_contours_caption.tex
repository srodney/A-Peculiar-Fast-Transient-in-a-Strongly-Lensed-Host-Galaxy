Probability distributions for the five primary magnification and
time-delay observables, drawn from a combination of results from five
of our seven baseline lens models: CATS, GLAFIC, GLEE, GRALE, and
ZLTM.  Contours shown in the ten panels at the lower left mark the
1$\sigma$ and 2$\sigma$ confidence regions in each two-dimensional
slice of the parameter space. Histograms at the top of each column
show the marginalized 1-D probability distributions, with
dashed vertical lines marking the mean and 1$\sigma$ confidence
region.  These mean values and uncertainties are also reported in the
table of values at the upper right. The final line in the table
reports the observed time gap in days between \spockone in January,
2014 and \spocktwo in August, 2014.
