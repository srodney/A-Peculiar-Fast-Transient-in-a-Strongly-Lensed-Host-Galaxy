\label{fig:StronglyLensedGalaxies}
Model-predicted magnification and redshift for strongly lensed
galaxies behind all six of the HFF clusters (Abell 2744, Abell 370,
Abell S1063, MACS J1149, MACS J0416, and MACS J0717).  The black curve
shows the minimum magnification required to make a \spock-like
transient detectable, as a function of redshift. To define the
distance modulus as a function of redshift for this curve, a
standard \LCDM cosmological model is adopted\cite{Planck:2016}.  Green
circles above the line represent the six galaxies in which a transient
with $M_{V}>-14$ mag would be sufficiently magnified, and red squares
below the line mark all the other galaxies in which the \spock events
would not have been detected.
