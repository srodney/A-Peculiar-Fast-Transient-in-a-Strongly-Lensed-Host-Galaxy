Piecewise linear fits to the \spock light curves, used to measure the
rise time and decay time of the two events.  The \spockone light curve
is shown in the top panel, and \spocktwo in the bottom. Filled points
with error bars plot the observed brightness of each event in AB
magnitudes as a function of rest-frame time (for
$z=1.0054$). Piecewise linear fits are shown for the four bands that
have enough points for fitting: in the top panel fits are plotted for
the F814W band (solid green lines) and the F435W band (dashed cyan
lines), while in the bottom panel fits are shown for F160W (solid
maroon) and F125W (dashed scarlet).  Open diamonds in each panel show
three examples of assumptions for the time of peak brightness, $t_{\rm
pk}$ (i.e., the position where the rising piece of the linear fit
ends).  Open circles mark the corresponding point, $t_{\rm pk} + t_3$,
at which the fading transient would have declined in brightness by 3
mag.  See text for details on the fitting procedure.
