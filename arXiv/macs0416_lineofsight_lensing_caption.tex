\label{fig:LineOfSightLenses}
Galaxies in the foreground and background of the MACS0416 cluster that
are included in the GLEE-var model, which is a variation of the GLEE
model that accommodates multi-plane lensing. The larger panel at left
marks nine galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts greater than the
cluster redshift (magenta circles) and four galaxies in the cluster
foreground (light-blue circles).  The inset panel at right zooms in on
the \spock host galaxy (enclosed by the orange ellipse in each panel).
Cluster member galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts that were
included in the GLEE models are marked with black diamonds.  The
magenta circle marks a spiral galaxy at $z=0.9397$, which is also
strongly lensed by the \macs0416 cluster into three highly distorted
images (System 12 in \citeref{Caminha:2017}). This image of the System
12 galaxy is further strongly lensed into arcs around a cluster member
galaxy, which is marked by the black diamond near the center of the
magenta circle.  The galaxy in the foreground of the cluster at
$z=0.0557$ is encircled in light blue.  Crosses mark the reconstructed
source positions (from the GLEE model) for the $z=0.9397$ galaxy and
the \spock host.
