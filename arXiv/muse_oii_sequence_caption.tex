\label{fig:MUSEOIISequence}
Measurements of the \forbidden{O}{ii} $\lambda\lambda$3726, 3729
doublet, observed with MUSE after both \spock events had faded.  The
upper-left panel shows the 12 apertures with radius 0.6\arcsec that
were used for the extractions reported in
Table~\ref{tab:MuseLineFits}.  Odd-numbered apertures are plotted with
solid lines, while even-numbered apertures are shown as unlabeled
dashed circles.  The apertures centered on the \spock-NW and SE
locations are highlighted in orange and magenta, respectively.  The
1-D spectra extracted from these \spock locations are shown in the
upper-right and lower-right panels, centered around the observed
wavelength of the \forbidden{O}{ii} doublet, and normalized to reach a
value of unity at the peak of the $\lambda$3729 line.  Dashed vertical
lines mark the vacuum wavelengths of the doublet, redshifted to
$z=1.0054$. The width of the shaded region indicates the $1\sigma$
uncertainty in the measured flux.  Below each spectrum, a residual
plot shows the flux that remains after subtracting off a mean spectrum
constructed from the normalized spectra of the odd-numbered apertures.
The lower-left panel shows the same residual spectra constructed for
the odd-numbered apertures, demonstrating that the \forbidden{O}{ii}
line profile does not exhibit any significant gradients across the
length of the host-galaxy arc.
