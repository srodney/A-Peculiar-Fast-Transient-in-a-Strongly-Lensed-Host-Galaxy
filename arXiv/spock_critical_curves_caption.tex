\label{fig:SpockCriticalCurves}
Locations of the lensing critical curves relative to the positions of
the two \spock sources. Panel (a) shows the \HST Frontier Fields
composite near-infrared image of the full \macs0416 field.  The
magnification map for a source at $z=1$ is overlaid with orange and
black contours\citet{Caminha:2017}.  The white box marks the region
that is shown in panel (b) with a closer view of the \spock host
galaxy.  Panel (c) shows a trace of the lensing critical curve from
the GRALE model, and panels (d)-(i) show magnification maps for the
six other primary models, all for a source at the \spock redshift.
The magnification maps are plotted with log scaling, such that white
is $\mu=1$ and black is $\mu=10^3$.  Panels j-m show the same
magnification maps, extracted from the lens model variations (see
Methods).
