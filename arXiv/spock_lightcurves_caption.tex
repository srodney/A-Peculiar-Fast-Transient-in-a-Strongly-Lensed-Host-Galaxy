\label{fig:LightCurves}
Light curves for the two transient events, \spockone\ on the left
and \spocktwo\ on the right.  Measured fluxes in micro-Janskys are
plotted against rest-frame time at $z=1.0054$, relative to the time of
the peak observed flux for each event. The corresponding Modified
Julian Date (MJD) in the observer frame is marked on the top axis for
each panel.  As indicated in the legend, optical observations using
the \HST\ ACS-WFC detector are plotted as circles, while infrared
measurements from the WFC3-IR detector are plotted as squares.
