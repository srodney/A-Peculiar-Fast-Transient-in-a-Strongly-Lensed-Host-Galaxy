Galaxies near the lines of sight to the \spockone and \spocktwo positions that impact the model-predicted gravitational lensing properties.   The \spock host galaxy is marked in cyan (images 11.1 and 11.2, system 13 in \citet{Caminha:2017}).  A galaxy at z=0.9397 (system 12 in \citet{Caminha:2017}), marked in magenta, is also lensed by the \macs0416 cluster.  The reconstructed source positions
