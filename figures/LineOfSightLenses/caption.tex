\label{fig:LineOfSightLenses}
Galaxies near the lines of sight to the \spockone and \spocktwo
positions that impact the model-predicted gravitational lensing
properties.  The \spock host galaxy is marked in cyan (images 11.1 and
11.2, or system 13 in \citet{Caminha:2017}).  Magenta circles enclose
a galaxy at z=0.9397 (system 12 in \citet{Caminha:2017}), which is
also strongly lensed by the \macs0416 cluster into three highly
distorted images.  The reconstructed source positions (from the GLEE-A
model) for the host galaxy (sys13) and the foreground galaxy (sys12)
are marked with smaller circles in cyan and magenta, respectively. A
galaxy at z=0.0557 in the foreground of the cluster is marked in
white.
