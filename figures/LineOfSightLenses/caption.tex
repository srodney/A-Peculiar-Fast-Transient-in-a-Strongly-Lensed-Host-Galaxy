\label{fig:LineOfSightLenses}
Galaxies in the foreground and background of the MACS0416 cluster that
are included in the GLEE-B multi-plane lens model. The larger panel at
left marks nine galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts greater than the
cluster redshift (magenta circles) and four galaxies in the cluster
foreground (light blue circles).  The inset panel at right zooms in on
the \spock host galaxy (enclosed by the orange ellipse in each panel).
The magenta circle marks a spiral galaxy at $z=0.9397$, which is also
strongly lensed by the \macs0416 cluster into three highly distorted
images (System 12 in \citet{Caminha:2017}).  Galaxy in the foreground
of the cluster at $z=0.0557$ is encircled in light blue.  Crosses mark
the reconstructed source positions (from the GLEE model) for the
$z=0.9397$ galaxy and the \spock host.
