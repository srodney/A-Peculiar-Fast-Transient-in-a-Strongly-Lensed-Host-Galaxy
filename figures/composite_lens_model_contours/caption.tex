Probability distributions for the five primary magnification and time
delay observables, drawn from a combination of results from five of
our seven baseline lens models: CATS, GLAFIC, GLEE, GRALE, and ZLTM.
Contours shown in the ten panels at the lower left mark the 1-$\sigma$
and 2-$\sigma$ confidence regions in each two-dimensional slice of the
parameter space. Histograms at the top of each column show the
marginalized one-dimensional probability distributions, with dashed
vertical lines marking the mean and 1$\sigma$ confidence region.
These mean values and uncertainties are also reported in the table of
values at the upper right.
