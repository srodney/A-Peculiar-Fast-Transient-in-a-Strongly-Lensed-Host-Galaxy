Probability distributions for the five primary magnification and time
delay observables, drawn from a combination of results from five lens
models: CATS-A, GLAFIC-A, GLEE-A, GRALE, and ZLTM.  Contours shown in
the ten panels at the lower left mark the 1-$\sigma$ and 2-$\sigma$
confidence regions in each 2D slice of the parameter space. Histograms
at the top of each column show the marginalized 1D probability
distributions, with dashed vertical lines marking the mean and
1$\sigma$ confidence region.  These mean values and uncertainties are
also reported in the table of values at the upper right.
