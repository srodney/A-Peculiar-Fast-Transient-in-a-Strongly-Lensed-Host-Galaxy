\label{fig:SpockDetectionImages}
The detection of \spockone and \spocktwo in HST imaging from the
Hubble Frontier Fields. The central panel shows the full field of the
MACSJ0416 cluster, in a combined image using optical and infrared
bands from HST.  Two boxes within the main panel demarcate the regions
where the \spock host galaxy images appear. These regions are shown as
two inset panels on the left, highlighting the three images of the
host galaxy (labeled 11.1, 11.2, and 11.3), whcih are caused by the
gravitational lensing of the cluster.  Two columns on the right side
show the discovery of the two transient events in optical and infrared
light, respectively.  In these final two columns the top row is a
template image, the center row shows the epoch when each transient
appeared, and the bottom row is the difference image.
