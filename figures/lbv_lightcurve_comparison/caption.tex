Comparison of observed \spock light curves against rapid outbursts
from two LBVs. Colored markers show the \spock light-curve data, as in
Figure~\ref{fig:LightCurves}, with downward arrows marking 3$\sigma$
upper limits in epochs with no detection of the \spock source. The LBV
comparison light curves have been shifted in time and magnitude to
match up with the peak of the observed light curves.
