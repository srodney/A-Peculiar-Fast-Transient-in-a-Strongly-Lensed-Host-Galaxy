\label{fig:RecurrentNovaLightCurveComparison}
Comparison of the \spock light curves against template light curves
for RN outbursts.  Colored markers show the \spock light-curve data,
as in Figure~\ref{fig:LightCurves}, plotting the apparent magnitude as
a function of time in the rest frame (bottom axis) and observer frame
(top axis). The gray shaded regions encompass the outburst light-curve
shapes of 5 of the 11 known Galactic RNe (U Sco, V2487 Oph, V394 CrA,
T CrB, and V745 Sco), selected because they exhibit a rapid decline in
their light curves\citep{Schaefer:2010}.  The solid black line traces
the 2014 outburst light-curve shape for the rapid-recurrence nova M31N
2008a-12\citep{Darnley:2014}.  All template light curves have been
normalized to match the observed peaks of the \spock events.
