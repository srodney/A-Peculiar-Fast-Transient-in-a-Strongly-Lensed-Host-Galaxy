\label{fig:RecurrentNovaRecurrenceComparison}
Comparison of the inferred \spock recurrence timescale against
observed RNe and models.  In the left panel the outburst amplitude in
magnitudes is plotted against the recurrence timescale, while in the
right panel the y axis shows the peak luminosity (or absolute
magnitude).  In both panels the joint constraints on \spock from both
transient episodes are plotted as large open diamonds, observed
constraints from the 10 galactic RNe appear as black `x' points, and
the rapid-recurrence nova M31N 2008a-12 is shown with a thick black
`+' marker.  Colored circles show the results from a suite of
numerical hydrodynamic simulations from \citet{Yaron:2005}.  The size
of each circle indicates the mass of the primary white dwarf (WD) star
over the range 0.4-1.4 M$_\odot$, as indicated in the legend of the
left panel.  The color of each circle denotes the rate of mass
transfer from the secondary onto the WD, as given in the right panel's
legend.
