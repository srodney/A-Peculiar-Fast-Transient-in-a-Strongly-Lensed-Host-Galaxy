Observed colors for the \spock events.  Filled points plotted in the
top panels show observed AB magnitudes for the \spockone and \spocktwo
events from -3 rest-frame days before the date of observed peak
brightness.  Solid lines and shaded regions show linear fits to the
data in the F814W and F160W bands.  Open points in the bottom panels
show observed colors in the rest-frame bands.  For each color the
magnitude in the bluer band is the directly measured value, and the
magnitude in the redder band is interpolated from the linear fits
shown in the top panel.  All colors are consistent with showing no
evolution over the rising portion of each light curve.
