\label{fig:SpockCriticalCurves}
Locations of the lensing critical curves relative to the positions of
the two \spock sources. Panel (a) marks the \spock locations on the
HST Frontier Fields near-infrared image of the MACS0416 field.
Panel (b) depicts a trace of the
lensing critical curve near the \spock positions from the GRALE
model, and panels c-m show magnification maps for a source at the \spock redshift, with log scaling, such that white is $\mu=1$ and black is $\mu=10^3$.
