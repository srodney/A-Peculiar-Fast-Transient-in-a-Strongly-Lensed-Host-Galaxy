\label{fig:SpockCriticalCurves}
Locations of the lensing critical curves relative to the positions of
the two \spock sources. Panel (a) marks the \spock locations on the
HST Frontier Fields image of the MACS0416 field in the F814W (I) band.
Panels b-f show magnification maps derived from the Kawamata, Jauzac,
Diego and Zitrin lens models.  All are scaled so that white is $\mu=1$
and black indicates $\mu=1000$.  Panel (g) depicts a trace of the
lensing critical curve near the \spock positions from the GRALE
model. The models shown in b, c and d have separate critical curves
passing near to the two \spock positions. Models in e, f and g have a
single critical curve passing between the two transient locations.
The GLAFIC v3.1 model shown in (c) was defined with the requirement
that multiple critical curves pass through the \spock locations.  All
other panels present the model realization that provides the best fit
to the lensing constraints.
