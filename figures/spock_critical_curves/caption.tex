\label{fig:SpockCriticalCurves}
Locations of the lensing critical curves relative to the positions of
the two \spock sources. Panel (a) shows the HST Frontier Fields
composite near-infrared image of the full \macs0416 field.  The
magnification map from the \citet{Caminha:2017} model is overlaid with
orange and black contours.  The white box is shown in panel (b) with a
closer view of the \spock host galaxy.  Panels b shows a trace of the
lensing critical curve from the GRALE model, and panels d-i show
magnification maps for the six other primary models, all for a source
at the \spock redshift.  The magnification maps are plotted with log
scaling, such that white is $\mu=1$ and black is $\mu=10^3$.  Panels
j-m show the same magnification maps, extracted from the lens model
variations described in \ref{sec:AlternativeModels}.
