\label{fig:SpockCriticalCurves}
Locations of the lensing critical curves relative to the positions of
the two \spock sources. Panel (a) marks the \spock locations on the
HST Frontier Fields near-infrared image of the MACS0416 field.
Panel (b) depicts a trace of the
lensing critical curve near the \spock positions from the GRALE
model, and panels c-i show magnification maps for a source at the \spock redshift, scaled so that white is $\mu=1$ and black is $\mu=10^4$. 
The GLAFIC v3.1 model shown in (i) was defined with the requirement
that multiple critical curves pass through the \spock locations
(Kawamata et al., in prep).  All other panels present the model
realization that provides the best fit to the lensing constraints.
