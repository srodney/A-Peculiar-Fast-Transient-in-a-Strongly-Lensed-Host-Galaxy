\label{fig:HostProperties}
Stellar population properties of the \spock host galaxy, derived from
``pixel-by-pixel'' SED fitting.  The top row shows maps for the adjacent
host images 11.1 and 11.2, and the bottom panels show image 11.3.
From left to right the panels present the rest-frame (U-V) color, the
stellar surface mass density, $\Sigma$, and the mean age of the
stellar population in Gyr.  Markers in the top row denote the
positions of the two \spock transient events. Markers in the bottom
panels are at the center of host image 11.3.
