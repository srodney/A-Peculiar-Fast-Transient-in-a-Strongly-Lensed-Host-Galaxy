\label{fig:LightCurves}
Light curves for the two transient events, \spockone\ on the left
and \spocktwo\ on the right.  Measured fluxes in micro-Janskys are
plotted against rest-frame time at $z=1.0054$, relative to the time of
the peak observed flux for each event. The corresponding Mean Julian
Date (MJD) in the observer frame is marked on the top axis for each
panel.  As indicated in the legend, optical observations using
the \HST\ ACS-WFC detector are plotted as circles in shades of blue
and green, while infrared measurements from the WFC3-IR detector are
plotted as red, orange and purple squares.
