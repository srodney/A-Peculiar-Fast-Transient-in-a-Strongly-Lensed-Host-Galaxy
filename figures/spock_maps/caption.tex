\label{fig:HostProperties}
Stellar population properties of the \spock host galaxy, derived from "pixel-by-pixel" SED fitting. 
The top row shows maps for the adjacent images 11.1 and 11.2, and the bottom panels show host image 11.3.  From left to right the panels present the rest-frame (U-V) color, the stellar surface mass density, $\Sigma$, and the mean age of the stellar population in Gyr.  Markers in the top row denote the positions of the two \spock transient events. Markers in the bottom panels are at the center of host image 11.3.
