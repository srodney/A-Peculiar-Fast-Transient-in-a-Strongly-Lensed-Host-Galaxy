\label{fig:SpockDelayPredictions}
Predictions for the reappearance episodes of both \spockone
and \spocktwo due to gravitational lensing time delays, as listed in
Table~\ref{tab:LensModelPredictions}.  The top panel shows photometry
collected at the NW position (host galaxy image 11.2) where the first
event (\spockone, labeled Spock-1) appeared in January, 2014.  Optical
measurements from ACS are in blue and green, and infrared observations
from WFC3-IR are in red and orange, as in
Figure~\ref{fig:LightCurves}.  Each blue bar in the lower panel shows
one lens model prediction for the dates when that same physical event
(\spockone) would have also appeared in the SE location (galaxy image
11.1), due to gravitational lensing time delay.  The lower panel plots
photometry from the SE position (11.1). On the right side we see the
second observed event (\spocktwo, labeled Spock-2).  The red bars above
show model predictions for when the NW host image 11.2 would have
exhibited the gravitationally delayed image of the \spocktwo\ event.
The width of each bar encompasses the 68\% confidence region for a
single model, and darker regions indicate an overlap from multiple
models.
